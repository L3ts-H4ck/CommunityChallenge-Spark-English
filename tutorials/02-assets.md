  # Make our assets and how to find resources <img src="https://www.enlinealasalle.com/pluginfile.php/8983/course/overviewfiles/vincent-van-gogh-png-2.png" height="25">

## On search of ressources

### - First we need to go to [metmuseum.org](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access), where we can find resources from the art collection from "The Met". We can use them, share them and more, without any restriction. This change of policies to Open source, is an important statement from The Met to show their commitment to raise the access to this collection via web.

### - We're going to the Image of ArtWorks in the Public domain section and click on The Met Collection

### - Once the page loads, we'll start a search with the name of the artist, the painting, or any other object you want, in this case we search for Van Gogh. I'm going to use the images of this artist to generate my elements.

### - Once our images deploy, we're going to click on the one we like the most. We need to make sure it has the Public Domain stamp and we procced to download it by clicking it on the arrow.

### - We'll have our elements in a folder, just to have everything in one place.

## Creating our elements

### - We procced to open our image editor and with it, the image we want. Something to keep in mind is that this editor needs to be able to select all our images and crop them, because we want to export them

### - I'm going to select the "quick selection" tool. This tool allow us to separate by colors the image and cut the background, before you cut it, make sure to duplicate the layer you are working on, you need to have always a backup. Once the copy is made, hide the original to get the transparency we're looking for.

### - In my case I'm going to remove the green background, the pot and the table, leaving only the leaves and flowers.

### - Once we achive this, I'll export it , section by section of flowers and leaves.

### - For our next element, you can access this drive, in wich you can find templates for your use.

### - Once inside the drive, we go to the Spark Assets folder.

### - Inside this folder you can find the following templates.

### - We'll open the BG template in Photoshop.

### - We'll open the image we just download from MetMuseum and we crop it.

<img src="https://github.com/L3ts-H4ck/CommunityChallenge-Spark/blob/master/tutorials/02-assets/14.png?raw=true" width="50%">

### - Once this step is ready, we need to paste our image in BG and adjust it until we like the result.

### - On the next tutorial, we'll learn how to use our assets inside a Facebook or Instagram filter.
